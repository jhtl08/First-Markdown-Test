>Nature and the cosmos do not speak our language. Nevertheless, they bombard us with lots of data to listen to. All that is left is for us to sort through the mess with the help of data science. Through data science, we unlock the mysteries of the universe. Through data science we obtain a better understanding of our place in this world. Through data science, we can peer through God's eyes.

Nature communicates through data. Through a comprehensive analysis of these data, the IPCC were able to release climate change reports [link] crucial for deciding the future of our planet and its inhabitants. Now, countries had made differing commitments, striking a balance between their economic, political, and moral standpoint. Hopefully, more and more people start to listen to data and the experts who study them. Nature calls us to be urgent.
