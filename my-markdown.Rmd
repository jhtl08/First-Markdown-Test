## Question 1: Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data?

>Our lives depend a lot on data. The more we study and understand a given set of data, as a response, we can decide on a more accurate or appropriate course of action.

>If we observe closely, we can retrieve data for just about anything. Even weird things such as how many times a jeepney makes its rounds, or how likely someone will purchase something useless just because it is on sale. Once we study and analyze this data we can create something useful and meaningful. Because of data scientists we have the luxury of having access to a myriad of information that is applicable to our professions, hobbies, and our daily lives.

>Nature and the cosmos do not speak our language. Nevertheless, they bombard us with lots of data to listen to. All that is left is for us to sort through the mess with the help of data science. Through data science, we unlock the mysteries of the universe. Through data science we obtain a better understanding of our place in this world. Through data science, we can peer through God's eyes.

## Question 2: Cite at least one instance or application where data science was used and contributed on policymaking, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.

>Nature communicates through data. Through a comprehensive analysis of these data, the IPCC were able to release [climate change reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/) crucial for deciding the future of our planet and its inhabitants. Now, countries had made differing commitments, striking a balance between their economic, political, and moral standpoint. Hopefully, more and more people start to listen to data and the experts who study them. Nature calls us to be urgent.

```{r fig.align="center", warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
df <- read.csv("https://query.data.world/s/am4fth46ih4simnozstddx5qpvmqto", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE);
ggplot(df, aes(x=X2014)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("CO2 Emissions Per Capita of Countries in 2014") +
  xlab("Countries in Alphabetical Order") +
  ylab("CO2 (tons) Per Capita")
```

## Question 3: Propose at least one data science topic that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical method you think you will need, and who would benefit this study.

>In my first two weeks here in the Philippines, I noticed that it rained almost everyday. Aleast, it's been that way since I arrived. During the times that it rained, I never had an umbrella with me. It’s mostly my fault for not checking the weather forecast, but at most times I felt it was unpredictable. One data science topic that I think would be interesting to pursue, is how often we must bring an umbrella with us in the Philippines. We can track the times when it had rained in the Philippines with this website **weather forecast reports** (https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/weather). From there we can create assumptions on when we need to take our umbrellas with us. The statistical methods that I will most likely use are Descriptive, Inferential, Associational methods.

>Books have proven to be a great source of knowledge and entertainment. Unfortunately, the rise of the internet had only decreased its popularity. It doesn’t have to be one or the other; we can also use the internet to promote more reading! Project Interlib will be an app/browser extension recommending users various books based on their interests. This will take advantage of machine learning using statistical tools such as [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) and [supervised clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). There will be plenty of data available for the machine learning process as most people use the internet and cookies can be found almost everywhere. Books are also complete with tags, genres, and lots of reviews. This will benefit people of all ages, bridging them to a better and happier version of themselves one book at a time.
