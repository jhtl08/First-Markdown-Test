## Question 1: Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data?

>Our lives depend a lot on data. The more we study and understand a given set of data, as a response, we can decide on a more accurate or appropriate course of action.

>If we observe closely, we can retrieve data for just about anything. Even weird things such as how many times a jeepney makes its rounds, or how likely someone will purchase something useless just because it is on sale. Once we study and analyze this data we can create something useful and meaningful. Because of data scientists we have the luxury of having access to a myriad of information that is applicable to our professions, hobbies, and our daily lives.

>Data science integrates a variety of historical data to predict outcomes based on explanations of past events. If we try to explore these data, it will not only predict outcomes but will also lead to answering different data relationships that will help a business to understand the dynamics of consumer behavior and reveal various data links.

>Nature and the cosmos do not speak our language. Nevertheless, they bombard us with lots of data to listen to. All that is left is for us to sort through the mess with the help of data science. Through data science, we unlock the mysteries of the universe. Through data science we obtain a better understanding of our place in this world. Through data science, we can peer through God's eyes.

>The study and analysis of data allows us to further visualize, identify, and understand many things in our world. Data might seem like statistics or numbers that only show a trend to some, but looking at it from different perspectives and thinking critically may lead to more findings and questions. How data is used and presented plays a big part in being more accessible and helpful to us.

## Question 2: Cite at least one instance or application where data science was used and contributed on policymaking, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.

>Various entertainment platforms such as Spotify, Netflix, Steam, and many more have employed data science to provide recommendations and further attract or improve the experience of users.

>When I used to play a ton of video games, I used a statistical application to track my in game stats for games like Apex Legends, Valorant, CS:GO and many other games. This application is called [blitz.gg](https://blitz.gg/). With the information present in this application, it has helped a multitude of players track their progress and their mastery on certain weapons. Which in turn helps players either play with their strengths or work on their weaknesses.

>Nature communicates through data. Through a comprehensive analysis of these data, the IPCC were able to release [climate change reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/) crucial for deciding the future of our planet and its inhabitants. Now, countries had made differing commitments, striking a balance between their economic, political, and moral standpoint. Hopefully, more and more people start to listen to data and the experts who study them. Nature calls us to be urgent.

df <- read.csv("https://query.data.world/s/am4fth46ih4simnozstddx5qpvmqto", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE);
ggplot(df, aes(x=X2014)) +

  ggtitle("CO2 Emissions Per Capita of Countries in 2014") +
  xlab("Countries in Alphabetical Order") +
  ylab("CO2 (tons) Per Capita")

>Data science may be used in education in order to help increase the quality of education and performance of the students. By analyzing data related to the students, it is possible to identify the steps and actions that may benefit the students.

***

## Question 3: Propose at least one data science topic that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical method you think you will need, and who would benefit this study.

>I am quite interested in the overall processes involved in games such as development, testing or maintenance. With the help of data science, games can be made more balanced and refined in various aspects such as its main systems, interface, or to provide a more specific example, tuning in-game characters' stats or skills. One could say that the gaming industry is growing at a rapid rate and therefore, this data science concept is very much relevant and significant to both occurring and future gamers. However, a disadvantage for now will be the availability of data since I think only gaming companies and developers may have the access to such data. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be helpful in this field. I think the predictive method may also be of help but I have not fully grasped how it can be used.

>In my first two weeks here in the Philippines, I noticed that it rained almost everyday. Aleast, it's been that way since I arrived. During the times that it rained, I never had an umbrella with me. It’s mostly my fault for not checking the weather forecast, but at most times I felt it was unpredictable. One data science topic that I think would be interesting to pursue, is how often we must bring an umbrella with us in the Philippines. We can track the times when it had rained in the Philippines with this website [**weather forecast reports**](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/weather)  . From there we can create assumptions on when we need to take our umbrellas with us. The statistical methods that I will most likely use are Descriptive, Inferential, Associational methods.

>Farmers' complaints over their unsold crops in the midst of the pandemic have frequently been reported in the press. Crops were either not transported, not sold, or were simply thrown away. Their time, money, and efforts were all squandered as a result of the supply chain's ineffective management. Despite the fact that these crops were wasted elsewhere, the price of similar crops increased significantly as a result of the scarcity of those crops in another area. The location of crops, planting and harvesting seasons, as well as the quantity of crops that can be grown in a particular location are valuable data that could help to prevent the reoccurrence of this situation. Data can be supplied by the crop producers and simply need to be gathered and analyzed in order to forecast and manage the distribution prior the harvesting time. Data can be used for strategic planning of the Department of Agriculture. Additionally, it will forecast when a given crop will be in excess in a particular place and needs to be distributed to areas where there is a supply shortfall. From this, the Department of Agriculture may learn when it is necessary to import or export the same goods. The Department of Agriculture, farmers, traders, and product consumers would all benefit from it. The statistical methods that I might use are descriptive, associational, predictive, and causal statistical methods.

>Books have proven to be a great source of knowledge and entertainment. Unfortunately, the rise of the internet had only decreased its popularity. It doesn’t have to be one or the other; we can also use the internet to promote more reading! Project Interlib will be an app/browser extension recommending users various books based on their interests. This will take advantage of machine learning using statistical tools such as [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) and [supervised clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). There will be plenty of data available for the machine learning process as most people use the internet and cookies can be found almost everywhere. Books are also complete with tags, genres, and lots of reviews. This will benefit people of all ages, bridging them to a better and happier version of themselves one book at a time.

>Social media is one of the most popular forms of entertainment in today’s world. However, it is not one without drawbacks. Social media can be addicting, and result in a great deal of negative effects on those affected by social media addiction. This is quite worrying, as the majority of the users of social media tend to be on the younger side. It is possible to look into data from surveys to be able to identify trends and relationships. An example of this may be related to which demographics are more likely to be affected by social media addiction. Through the use of predictive, inferential, and associational statistical methods, this may benefit a wide variety of people suffering from the effects of social media addiction.
